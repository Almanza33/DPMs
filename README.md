# DPMs

## Implementation of a two Diffusion Probabilistic Models.
- ImagesDPM contains a DPM trained on the 64x64px images from the flowers102 dataset.
- ParticlesDPM contains a DPM trained to learn 2d and 3d out of equilibrium particle distributions.

These are code adaptations based on the implementations by Raha Ahmadi in Diffusion Model Scratch and Álvaro Barbero Jiménez in Toy diffusion public Githubs.
